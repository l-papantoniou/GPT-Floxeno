# GPT-Filoxeno

An innovative project that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and LangChain to answer questions using custom datasets.
Project Description

This project is a blend of the powerful natural language processing capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 and LangChain. By
inputting a custom dataset, the system generates accurate and natural responses to a variety of queries.
Features

    Custom Dataset Input: You can feed in your own data for highly personalized responses.
    High Accuracy: Utilizes the cutting-edge GPT-3.5 model for highly accurate results.
    LangChain Integration: Leverages LangChain for added flexibility and robustness.

# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó About LangChain: 

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:

    Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
    Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:

    Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
    Off-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.

# Embeddings
What are embeddings?

OpenAI‚Äôs text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:

    Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
    Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
    Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
    Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
    Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
    Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)

An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness.
Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.
